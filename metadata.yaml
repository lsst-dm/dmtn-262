description: "Calibration production and verification has relied on notebooks for the majority of the visualization, a choice that scales poorly as we move from the analysis of LATISS images to the full camera.  The metric and plotting interfaces currently defined in ``analysis_tools`` provide a much better way to organize and present the data from these calibration steps.  However, there is still some missing functionality that needs to be added for this to fully solve this problem.  This tech note will present an initial set of issues and goals for this integration."
